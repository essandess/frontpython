#summary Making plugins in Python 101

 # Download the SDK. We currently recommend downloading the source from subversion, as we haven't really made an official release yet.
 # Copy the files from the SDK/ directory to your own directory.
 # Edit English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings. The CFBundleName is the name that will appear in the menu.
 # Edit the setup.py file. You'll want to change the NSPrincipleClass, CFBundleExecutable, and CFBundleName..
 # Rename FrontPython.py to match what you named the CFBundleExecutable (followed by the .py)..
 # Edit your newly named file, and change the name of the class that overrides PyFR.Appliance to match the name you entered for NSPrincipleClass.
 # Run "python setup.py py2app -A". This creates a plugin for you, in the dist directory. It will be named after what you put into CFBundleName (I think, untested)
 # Create a symlink in your FrontRow directory: ln -s <path to your project>/dist/<projectname>.frappliance /System/Library/CoreServices/Front Row.app/Contents/PlugIns/
 # Restart Frontrow.

At this point, you should be able to see your plugin in Frontrow.
