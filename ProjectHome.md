This project allow programmers to create plugins for Apple's Front Row 2.0, that was released with OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

Currently, its in a basic stage, only serving as an example of how to create plugins.

The only known working plugin currently is the FrontMyth plugin. The code for this is available in the examples area.

**Future plans**
  * Convenience classes to create recursive menus, and other simplifications.
  * possibly support AppleTV. I do not have an AppleTV to test with, but since the py2app stuff seems to place all the support libraries for Python, this **may** work. I plan on buying an AppleTV in a few months to test, unless someone else takes up the cause.

**A big thanks to the Sapphire group, who released their source code, which I heavily based this on.**
